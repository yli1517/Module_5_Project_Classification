# Module_5_Project_Classification

## Members:

 - [ ] Sonia Mahop
 - [ ] Yijing Li

## Goals:

 - [ ] Diabetes prediction using machine learning classification methods. 

## Responsibilities

 - [ ] Data import and data cleaning: Yijing
 - [ ] Build logistic regression and decision tree models and model evaluation: Yijing
 - [ ] Build SVM and random forest models and model evaluation: Sonia
 - [ ] We both worked on the notebooks and the presentation

## Summary of the Files

 - [ ] README file lists project members, goal, responsibilities, and a summary of the files
 - [ ] Technical Notebook targets to a technical audience
 - [ ] An executive summary project presentation in pdf format
 - [ ] Pyfiles that contain functions for data import, cleaning, and feature engineering 
 
 ## Deliverables
 - [ ] A Technical Jupyter Notebook containing any code you've written for this project. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project. This notebook is clean and narrative. Extra data cleaning functions and additional EDA should be done in separate notebooks or, preferably, in separate .py files.

 - [ ] An organized README.md file in the GitHub repository that describes the nature and contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository.

 - [ ] An "Executive Summary" PowerPoint Presentation that gives a brief overview of your problem & dataset and shows the different models you've generated trying to solve the problem. The emphasis should be on showcasing your model evaluation and how you determined which model performs best.
